# **Exercises**
### Before You Begin: Create a new Git feature branch for this assignment. **See Git Checkpoint Workflow: Before Each Assignment** for details.

### 1. Peruse the **Official React documentation** by Facebook, note down anything interesting you find and discuss learnings with your mentor and Bloc Slack community. In addition, discuss with your mentor a strategy to read documentation more efficiently. This is a critically important skill to develop as software developer, as technologies keep evolving.

Per my mentor ... read. watch. practice. comeback to the docs w/ more context
Things to keep in mind ... documentation changes over time ... updates may make drastic changes to your library or framework ... come back to the documentation after you have begun using a library or framework as your understanding of the documentation may only go so deep at the beginning ... especially if you have never used the library or framework ... practice brings familiarity


###2. Referring to the official documentation, build another simple React component from scratch similar to the one we built. Discuss your experience building the component from scratch with your mentor.
